## Overview

This project completely implements the **Quantium Virtual Internship (QVI)**, delivered two tasks using real-world retail transaction data. It covers exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, brand insights, and statistical evaluation of trial store performance ‚Äî culminating in business-ready recommendations.

## Tasks Summary

### **Task 1: Customer, Brand & Life Stage Segmentation**
- Performed exploratory analysis on:
  - Popular brands across customer segments
  - Differences in customer behavior by **life stage** (Midage single/couple, new families, older families, retirees, young families, and young single/couple) and **premium status** (Budget, Mainstream, Premium)
  - Trends in product quantity, average price, and total sales
- Used bar plots, groupby summaries, and statistical tests (t-tests) to uncover insights
- **Key findings:**
  - **Older singles/couples, and retirees** are strong spenders on chips
  - **Kettle**, **Doritos**, and **Pringles** are popular brands across segments
  - **New Families** are the *least engaged* customer group
  - **Young single/couples, and midage single/couples** spent the highest average price per packet of chips across all customer segments.
  - **Young single/couples, and midage single/couples** prefer **Kettle and Doris** though these brands have the highest average prices.

#### Example Outputs:
- Total sales by customer group

### **Task 2: Trial Store Performance Evaluation**
- **Objective:** Assess the effectiveness of a **product trial in 3 stores**
- Selected **control stores** using:
  - Correlation on pre-trial trends (sales, customer count)
  - Standardised **magnitude distance** scoring

| Trial Store | Control Store |
|-------------|----------------|
| 77          | 233            |
| 86          | 155            |
| 88          | 237            |

- Conducted rigorous analysis using:
  - **Scaled sales comparisons**
  - **Percentage uplift calculations**
  - **T-statistics and confidence intervals**

**Final Conclusion:**
- **Stores 77 and 88** showed **statistically significant uplift**
- **Store 86** did not
- **Overall**, the trial shows a significant increase in sales.
